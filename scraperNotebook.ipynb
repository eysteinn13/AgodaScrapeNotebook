I had the deluxe aircon room and was very pleased with it. Although the location is away from everything touristy in Phuket, I didn't mind because it was just a place to stay for the night because my next flight was in the morning. The room was very clean and comfortable with a big bed, TV, really cool aircon, and a very nice bathroom. The shower was the best I'd had after nearly a month of backpacking...I was pretty impressed. One of the staff gave us a tuktuk ride to the beach for dinner and then came back and picked us up for about 100B. My flight the next morning was at 6:45AM so I asked the shuttle driver if he could take me to the airport around 5AM and it was no problem for him.\\n\\nOverally, a very nice stay and highly recommended for someone who is just passing through Phuket and needs a nice, clean, and comfortable place to stay after a long month of living in sub-par hostels!\"), ('7.3', \"Small hotel close to the airport. It's close but tricky to find (down a dark, quiet drive) so if you are arriving at night, it might be good to have a taxi bring you or perhaps even ask for them to come and collect you. The owner was friendly but tired, with guests arriving at all hours. Rooms look ok and are clean and comfortable. Place is built so that the rooms are facing an inner courtyard. Very safe. Rooms have a large, wall-mounted TV with plenty of English channels, wifi in room, terrific shower, kettle with coffee and tea and we booked a fan room but were upgraded to air con. Bed is super comfortable. Not much to do in the area so this is really just for those that are arriving late or have an early flight and don't want to commute an hour or more into Phuket. For those looking for somewhere to overnight, I highly recommend Airport Overnight Hotel.\"), ('5.7', 'hotel is not on the main road, so get the taxi driver is call the hotel if he doesnt know where it is, otherwise you could be driving around for awhile as its in a back street but only 5 mins walk to airort. didnt relised we booked a (fan only] room so would of been abit more comfortable and less noisey if we were in a a/c room but other then that, was clean,value for money, and has a free airort drop off even if its middle of the night/morning. our fan suite had a reasonablly good size room/bed, bathroom,toilet, flat screen tv, complementry bottles of water on arrival,tea/coffee facilities. older style building.'), ('6.0', 'basic room, no real ammenities, but conveniant to the airport if just for one night...'), ('7.0', 'The room privacy and cleanliness are well-rated for this hotel.
